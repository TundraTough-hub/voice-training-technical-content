- Use clear articulation, especially for technical terms
- Vary inflection to maintain listener engagement
- Avoid vocal fry and uptalk patterns

### Emphasis Patterns
- Emphasize key technical terms on first mention
- Use slight emphasis for numerical values and units
- Stress important safety-related information
- Highlight regulatory requirements and standards

## Segment-Specific Notes

### Segments 1-3: Engineering Fundamentals
- Emphasize mathematical concepts and equations
- Pronounce chemical names clearly and consistently
- Stress units of measurement
- Use authoritative tone for established principles

### Segments 4-6: Regulatory and Health
- Emphasize regulatory agency names and acronyms
- Stress compliance requirements and deadlines
- Use concerned but professional tone for health risks
- Highlight action levels and maximum limits

### Segments 7-9: Risk and Business

## Technical Term Guidelines

### First Mention Protocol
1. State the full term clearly
2. Provide acronym or abbreviation if applicable
3. Brief pause before definition or explanation
4. Use slower pace for complex pronunciations

### Repeated Terms
- Use consistent pronunciation throughout
- Maintain clear articulation even with familiarity
- Occasional re-emphasis for key concepts

### Numbers and Units
- Spell out numbers one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Always include units of measurement
- Pronounce decimal points as "point"
- Use "percent" rather than "%" symbol

## Breathing and Pacing

### Natural Pause Points
- End of sentences: 1-2 seconds
- Between major sections: 2-3 seconds
- Before lists or enumeration: 1 second
- After questions: 2 seconds

### Breath Management
- Take breathing breaks at paragraph boundaries
- Use diaphragmatic breathing for voice support
- Avoid mid-sentence breathing unless absolutely necessary
- Plan breath breaks during content review

## Error Handling

### Minor Errors
- Continue without stopping for minor mispronunciations
- Self-correct only if meaning could be unclear
- Avoid drawing attention to small mistakes

### Major Errors
- Stop and restart sentence for significant errors
- Use phrase "Let me restate that" for clarity
- Ensure accuracy for safety-critical information

## Equipment and Environment

### Microphone Technique
- Maintain consistent distance (6-8 inches)
- Avoid handling noise and paper rustling
- Position microphone slightly off-axis to reduce plosives
- Use pop filter for plosive sounds (p, b, t, d, k, g)

### Room Acoustics
- Record in acoustically treated space if possible
- Minimize background noise and interruptions
- Avoid echoing or reverberant spaces
- Test recording quality before starting full sessions

### Session Management
- Warm up voice before recording
- Stay hydrated but avoid dairy before recording
- Take breaks every 20-30 minutes
- Review content beforehand to familiarize with flow

## Quality Control

### Post-Recording Review
- Listen to recordings for consistent quality
- Check pronunciation of technical terms
- Verify all numbers and measurements
- Ensure segment timing meets 10-minute target

### File Management
- Use consistent naming convention
- Include segment number and topic in filename
- Maintain backup copies of all recordings
- Document any retakes or corrections needed
